Python for NCEA units.odp is a slide show that may be useful in understanding
the New Zealand secondary school National Certificate of Education (NCEA)
processes.

Computing and Digital Technologies are two subjects in the secondary school
ciriculum. Some of the units in these subjects may be completed using python.

Also included are a series of `circle_x.py` programs. These are to demonstrate
levels of complexity in python programming techniques. From non-structured, to
using functions, using classes, and importing modules.
