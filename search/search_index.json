The idea was to get a visual representation of the words that were said the most by a particular band or artist. The two main methods for doing this were through geturl() and getbetween() . geturl() is self-explanatory, and getbetween() allows us to find all strings that are in between two strings, for a particular body of text. So we use this method to basically wrangle data out of the HTML. As I mentioned in the talk, this way of doing things is kind of crude - it's good for quick one-offs or if you don't care about anything apart from getting the data. But there are nicer ways of doing this, such as using BeautifulSoup where you can navigate the DOM of the HTML. Hell, I should probably use that more often too! As mentioned at the start, we used both Wordle and R to generate our wordclouds. Wordle makes nicer wordclouds but it may be less accessible from a programmatic standpoint. R makes reasonably good looking wordclouds but it involves a lot of fiddling with parameters! Usage python get.py > output/out.txt Note that there is a boolean flag in the script called ONLINE - if it's set to true, then it will download the .html files (that correspond to lyrics from each song) and save them to a folder called saved in the same directory as the script. Otherwise if the boolean is set to false it will assume you already have the .html files in that folder and then do everything locally. I have also made other improvements to the script since the presentation, such as having the script create the output directory for you if it doesn't exist, etc. Then you can copy and paste the contents of out.txt into Wordle or use the R script create-cloud.R (if you know R!).

Presentation Notes IPython is an interactive shell, originally for Python. Though it is now being generalized, via the Jupyter project, to handle other languages on an equal basis. IPython interfaces to the language implementation via its own \u201ckernel\u201d process. Separate from the kernel is the front end, of which there are three: one based on a character terminal, one built with the Qt GUI toolkit, and the web-based notebook interface. Of the three, the notebook interface is the most powerful, it\u2019s the only one I have much experience with, and it is the one I will talk about here. If you\u2019ve used Mathematica, the notebook concept will be very familiar. The kernel process maintains a context for script programs that is preserved for as long as the kernel remains running. Thus, you can feed a command to define a variable or open a file, and then later send another command to access that variable or do something with that file. When the kernel is terminated, all such context is lost. The notebook server is a custom web server, so the user interface can be provided via any modern web browser. A notebook file (extension \u201c.ipynb\u201d) is actually a text file in JSON format. Its content is a sequence of cells. Each cell can contain program-language text (in Python, in this case) to be executed by the kernel, or text that is only to be read by the user of the notebook, which can be nicely formatted using Markdown markup. The latter text can also include mathematical formulas in the appropriate subset of LATEX markup, implemented by the MathJax library, which is written in JavaScript and does all its actual rendering in the web browser. Program cells can generate text or graphical output, which is displayed immediately following the cell when it is executed. They can also generate Markdown or mathematical markup by using the appropriate API calls, allowing the convenient display of dynamically-generated formatted text or mathematical formulas as well as more general graphics. Not only that, but program code can also define simple interactive \u201cwidgets\u201d (e.g. sliders, text-input fields) to create a very basic custom GUI that allows the user to interact with the cell output. The notebook file saves the original cell content, along with the formatted representation of non-program cells. Remember that the in-memory program context (variables, open files etc) lives only in the kernel process, not the notebook front-end. There is no command that simply saves the current notebook under its current name. There is a \u201cSave and Checkpoint\u201d command, which saves the notebook and also makes a time-stamped \u201ccheckpoint\u201d copy in the \u201c.ipynb_checkpoints\u201d subdirectory. Also the notebooks is periodically autosaved, at an interval that defaults to 2 minutes. Alternatively, you can simply close the notebook window/tab; if there are unsaved changes, you get prompted whether you really want to leave the page. Regardless of what you select here, the notebook will be saved. What about security? First of all, a notebook can execute arbitrary code. The notebook server, and the kernel, make no attempt to constrain the kinds of programs that can be executed. The assumption is that these are running on machines under the user\u2019s control, executing code specified by the user. Therefore it is not their job to limit what the user can do. There is another issue, that of receiving a notebook from another (possibly untrusted) source and executing arbitrary code from that. IPython doesn\u2019t prevent you from doing this. But it will not automatically execute JavaScript from cached cell output, unless the notebook signature is verified against a key known to the user https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/security.html . Normally each user generates their own key, but it is possible to share keys with trusted colleagues. IPython lets you set up multiple profiles, and easily switch between them. These let you create different sets of custom default settings for different usages. Profiles can also be used to isolate trust between different groups that you work with.

This speedometer configuration is more conceptual than practical, as it would be rather difficult to ride a bike while looking at a monitor and using a keyboard and mouse. It is designed to introduce you to the client / server programming methodology and the python libraries pydbus, RPi.GPIO, and GTK+. From the hardware perspective it involves: * A bicycle with a magnet attached to the spokes.[1] * A hall effect sensor chip to detect rotation of the bike wheel.[1] * A Raspberry Pi ARM architecture computer.[1] * A GUI display screen, keyboard and mouse. [1]: Testing with simulated input may be performed on a i386 / AMD64 Linux desktop or laptop computer. Running these applications on a laptop may help with understanding client / server methodology. From the sofware perspective it utilizes: * RPi.GPIO python library to provide a call_back to count every rotation of the wheel. * A repeating timer class to provide a call_back at a fixed interval of, say, one second. * Utilizing the real time clock with the built-in time.time() to have time in days, hours, minutes and seconds. * A server application to capture the wheel rotations and perform speed calculations. * A client application to provide the GUI. * Uses the pydbus library to provide DBus interprocess communications between the client and the server applications. Pydbus is a python wrapper for the DBus components of the GObject Introspection repository. Installation If using a Raspberry Pi then install the Raspbian distro or the Ubuntu Mate distro for the R-Pi 2 or 3. If simulating on a desktop/laptop then use a linux distro. E.g. Ubuntu. Both Raspbian and Ubuntu Mate (for R-Pi) include the RPi.GPIO python module for interacting with the R-Pi's GPIO pins. If you have a Raspberry Pi and a Hall Effect sensor module. Connect the Hall Effect sensor to, say, GPIO channel number 2 on the Raspberry Pi. The pydbus library is unlike to have been included with your Raspbian/Ubuntu distro. Enter this console command to install it from the PyPI repository. $ pip3 install pydbus From this github folder copy these gtk_client.py and server.py to your computer. Open one console terminal window, set default to the folder with these client and server applications, and type $ python3 server.py Open another console terminal window, set default to the folder with these client and server applications and type $ python3 gtk_client.py The GUI should now open and if you start riding your bike then you should be getting distances and speeds being displayed. Edit the source code on server.py to set your wheel_circumference to the correct number of meters. If you don't have a R-Pi or hall-effect sensor, then you should see speeds and distances changing on the GUI display as a result of random numbers being generated to simulate wheel rotations. Future While this demonstrates the client / server methodology, enhancements to this code in the future may be: Have one GUI but have multiple server processes supplying data from a variety of sources. Have servers that \"emit\" their data over the DBus, rather than supplying it on commands received from the client.

Presenter: Ian Stewart The presention at the meeting held on 13 May 2019 covered the following: - Obtaining a reStructuredText (reST) editor. - Using the editor to create reST web-pages. - Creating a python virtual environment - Installing Nikola static website generator application in the virtual environment. - Using Nikola to convert the reST web-pages into html files and generate the website. - Creating a free beginners account on PythonAnywhere - Uploading the web-site to the PythonAnywhere account. In a somewhat recursive scenario, the presentation that Ian delivered is captured in a website that he created. Please review the website http://hampug1.pythonanywhere.com As part of the presentation Ian performed many linux bash commands to create the basic template for the web-site he built. These commands are attached as the file presentation_history . You can replace your ~/.bash_history file with this presentation_history file. By recalling your bash history in sequence with the bash history commands, !1, !2, !3, etc., you may repeat the delivery in the presentation and create your own template web-site. You may then modify the template to build your own web-site. As part of the presentation a modified Nikola conf.py file is used called conf_quiet.py . Please find this file in this repository and place it in your home folder. The conf_quiet.py file is the conf.py file with edits in four places. Search with the string Edited by Ian to see what the editing involved. Attached are the files: - presentation_history - conf_quiet.py The presentation_history file is installed on your linux laptop computer as follows: - Place the presentation_history file into your home folder. I.e.

In a somewhat recursive scenario, the presentation that Ian delivered is captured in a website that he created. Please review the website http://hampug1.pythonanywhere.com As part of the presentation Ian performed many linux bash commands to create the basic template for the web-site he built. These commands are attached as the file presentation_history . You can replace your ~/.bash_history file with this presentation_history file. By recalling your bash history in sequence with the bash history commands, !1, !2, !3, etc., you may repeat the delivery in the presentation and create your own template web-site. You may then modify the template to build your own web-site. As part of the presentation a modified Nikola conf.py file is used called conf_quiet.py . Please find this file in this repository and place it in your home folder. The conf_quiet.py file is the conf.py file with edits in four places. Search with the string Edited by Ian to see what the editing involved. Attached are the files: - presentation_history - conf_quiet.py The presentation_history file is installed on your linux laptop computer as follows: - Place the presentation_history file into your home folder. I.e. Your ~/ folder. - Open one console terminal window on your laptop. - Check that you have .bash_history file. $ ls -l .bash_history - Make a backup: $ cp .bash_history bash_history_backup_$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S') - Overwrite the bash_history: $ cp presentation_history .bash_history - Clear history currently in memory: $ history -c - Close the console terminal window.
